A fee of more than twenty-five cents shall not be asked or received for taking an acknowledgment.

C.  A livestock officer or livestock inspector may stop any person who is in possession of and is conveying, shipping or transporting livestock or hides of livestock to examine brands, marks, certificates of brand inspection and bills of lading or bills of sale relating to the livestock in transit if the officer or inspector has probable cause or reasonable suspicion to believe that the person has violated any provision of this title or title 13 relating to livestock.
D. Livestock officers and livestock inspectors may enter any premises where livestock are kept or maintained to examine brands or marks or other evidence of ownership or to determine the health or welfare of livestock. If admittance is refused and probable cause exists, the livestock officer may immediately request an administrative inspection warrant from the nearest court of competent jurisdiction to allow such entry.
