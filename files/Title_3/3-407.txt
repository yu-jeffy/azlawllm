B. In compiling the list, the department may use records required to be kept by shippers and records reported to citrus, fruit and vegetable standardization by producers and shippers pursuant to articles 2 and 4 of this chapter and rules adopted pursuant to those articles. The department may also notify known affected persons and may request them to respond within fifteen days after the notice with any additional necessary information.
