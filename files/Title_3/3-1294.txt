3-1294.Improperly maintaining a stallion or jack; classification; seizure and sale; expenses for care
A. A person who maintains a stallion or jack with reckless disregard for the safety or health of other persons or property or livestock of another is guilty of a class 2 misdemeanor.
B. In addition, the appropriate court, on affidavit by the livestock officer, may issue an order to seize and impound the stallion or jack until remedial action has been taken by the owner, agent or person in charge of the stallion or jack. If no remedial action has been taken after twenty days, the livestock officer shall sell the stallion or jack to the highest bidder for cash at public auction. Immediately after the sale is made, or after release to the owner who pays the hauling charges and expenses of feeding and caring for the livestock, the livestock officer shall remit the proceeds to the agency together with an itemized statement of the expense of the seizure and sale, which shall be paid as other claims. The amount received by the agency shall be deposited in the livestock custody trust fund established by section 3-1377 and retained until final determination by the court of all actions arising from the seizure of the stallion or jack.
