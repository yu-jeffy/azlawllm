An applicant for a license shall give proof satisfactory to the associate director of his ability to perform his duties and shall pay a license fee of five dollars. The license shall be valid for the calendar year in which issued and upon payment of a renewal fee of one dollar fifty cents shall be renewed for each year in which the licensee desires to operate. A license not renewed prior to February 1 is void.
B. No person shall test milk or cream for the purpose of determining the butterfat content thereof, when the result of the test is used to determine the purchase sales value or the legal standard of the product, unless the tester has a tester's license. A tester's license may be obtained from the division by presenting a certificate of proficiency, and payment of a license fee of five dollars. The license shall be valid for the calendar year in which issued, and upon payment of a renewal fee of one dollar fifty cents shall be renewed for each year in which the tester desires to operate.

Upon successfully completing the examination the department of dairy husbandry shall issue the certificate to an applicant displaying required proficiency. A tester's license issued by a state other than this state shall be accepted from the person named thereon in lieu of the certificate of proficiency, but the tester shall have been actively engaged in testing under the license for a period of not less than ninety days and shall furnish proof thereof. Each license shall be kept at the place in which the licensee is employed and shall be open to inspection.
