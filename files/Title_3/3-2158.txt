No person shall buy, sell, transport or offer for sale or transportation or receive for transportation in intrastate commerce any poultry carcasses or parts or products thereof which are not intended for use as human food unless they are denatured or otherwise identified as required by the rules of the director or are naturally inedible by humans.
B. The following classes of persons shall, for such period of time as the director may by rules prescribe, but not to exceed two years unless otherwise directed by the director for good cause shown, keep such records as are properly necessary for the effective enforcement of this article in order to insure against adulterated or misbranded poultry products for the consumer and all persons subject to such requirements shall at all reasonable times, upon notice by a duly authorized representative of the department, afford such representative access to their places of business and opportunity to examine the facilities, and inventory thereof, and to take reasonable samples of their inventory upon payment of the fair market value therefor:
