Whenever any poultry product, or any product exempted from the definition of a poultry product, or any dead, dying, disabled or diseased poultry is found by any authorized representatives of the department upon any premises where it is held for purposes of, or during or after distribution in, intrastate commerce, and there is reason to believe that any such article is adulterated or misbranded and is capable of use as human food, or that it has not been inspected, in violation of this or any other state or federal law or that it has been or is intended to be distributed in violation of any such provisions, it may be detained by such representative for a period of not to exceed twenty days, pending action under section 3-2166 or notification of any federal, state or other governmental authority having jurisdiction over such article or poultry, and shall not be moved by any person from the place at which it is located when so detained until released by such representative. All official marks may be required by such representative to be removed from such article or poultry before it is released unless it appears to the satisfaction of the division that the article or poultry is eligible to retain such marks.
