3-611.Tuberculin testing of dairy herds; veterinarian's certificate; other diseases; exclusion of animals from herds
A. Except as otherwise provided by law, a tuberculin test of all dairy herds shall be made before milk therefrom is sold. Thereafter, testing shall be conducted and reactors disposed of as prescribed by chapter 12, article 3 of this title. A certificate signed by a licensed veterinarian and filed with the state veterinarian shall be evidence of the test required by this section.
B. A cow showing upon physical examination an extensive or entire induration of one or more quarters of the udder, whether or not secreting abnormal milk, shall be permanently excluded from the milking herd. A cow giving bloody, stringy or otherwise abnormal milk, but with only a slight induration of the udder, shall be excluded from the herd until re-examination shows the milk to have become normal.
C. The associate director, on the recommendation of the state veterinarian, may, for a disease not otherwise provided for, prescribe the tests and examinations to be used. He shall prescribe the times at which the tests shall be given and the methods to be used and shall provide for the disposition of animals reacting to the tests.
