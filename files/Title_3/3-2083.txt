3-2083.Authority of inspector to search for and seize unstamped meat
Inspectors may stop and search without warrant any vehicle, and may search without warrant any container which the inspector suspects contains unstamped meat, and if any is found it shall be taken by the inspector. Unless proof is submitted within twenty-four hours after such seizure which satisfies the inspector that the person from whom the meat was taken is the lawful owner thereof, such meat shall be forfeited to the state and sold or disposed of by the agency.
