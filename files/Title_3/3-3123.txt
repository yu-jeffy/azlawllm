3-3123.Testimony of witnesses; compensation; order of superior court to appear
The director may require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence under oath. Witnesses are entitled to be paid the same fees and mileage paid witnesses in the courts of this state. If any person fails or refuses to obey such an order, the director may apply to the superior court in any county where the person is found, resides or transacts business for an order requiring the person to produce evidence and to give testimony as ordered. The failure to obey such order is contempt of court.
