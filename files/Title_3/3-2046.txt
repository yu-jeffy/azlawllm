A. The director shall adopt reasonable rules necessary to assure that all meat and meat products subject to inspection under this article which are to be sold or distributed for human consumption are free from unwholesome, poisonous or other foreign substances and filth, insects or disease causing organisms. The rules shall provide reasonably necessary measures governing the production, processing, labeling, storing, handling and transportation of such products. The rules shall prescribe minimum standards for the sanitary facilities and conditions which shall be maintained at any plant, packing house or abattoir and in any truck or other vehicle in which meat or meat products are produced, processed, stored, handled or transported.
B. The director upon the advice of the chief veterinary meat inspector shall adopt reasonable rules, including, but not limited to, what the antemortem and postmortem inspection shall consist of, to carry out the purposes of this chapter. The rules shall conform so far as possible to the rules governing meat inspection of the United States department of agriculture. To the extent deemed appropriate by the director the rules may incorporate by reference existing federal meat inspection regulations, but in no case shall the rules exceed the requirements of the United States department of agriculture.
