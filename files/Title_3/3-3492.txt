Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, the associate director of the division in consultation with the director of the department of environmental quality shall approve alternate fuel control measures that are submitted by gasoline providers and that the director and the associate director determine will result in motor vehicle carbon monoxide emissions that are equal to or less than emissions that result under compliance with subsection A of this section and section 3-3433. In making this determination, the associate director of the division and the director of the department of environmental quality shall compare the emissions of the alternate fuel control measure with the emissions of a fuel with a maximum vapor pressure standard as prescribed by section 3-3433 and with the minimum oxygen content or percentage by volume of ethanol as prescribed by this section.
C. Any alternate fuel control measures that are approved shall not increase emissions of non-methane hydrocarbons, particulates, carbon monoxide or oxides of nitrogen. Alternate fuel control measures approved pursuant to subsection B of this section and this subsection may be used by any gasoline provider unless the approval is rescinded more than one hundred eighty days before the first day of a gasoline control period. Gasoline providers that use an approved alternate fuel control measure shall annually submit a compliance plan to the associate director no later than sixty days before the first day of a gasoline control period.
