3-371.Cease and desist order
The director of the Arizona department of agriculture or the director of the department of health services may issue a cease and desist order for not to exceed twenty-four hours, or until an administrative hearing is held, to terminate the application of pesticides if either or both find that an imminent and serious hazard to the public health and safety exists.  The order is immediately effective.  The order shall also set a time, but not later than twenty-four hours after the date and time of the order, for the hearing on the order.  If evidence produced at the hearing shows that the order was unreasonable and that public health and safety were not threatened or that conditions have changed making the order unnecessary, the order shall be revoked.  Except as provided in section 41-1092.08, subsection H, a party to the final administrative decision on the cease and desist order may obtain judicial review pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6.
