3-372.Emergency use of pesticides
During a time when a person's license, permit, certificate or registration is under suspension or revocation or an order has been issued, a person requiring the application of a pesticide may apply to the director for emergency relief. If the director determines that an emergency exists which requires an application of pesticide, the director may authorize an application of pesticide under supervision and under conditions prescribed by the director. The cost of such supervision shall be borne by the person whose permit or license is suspended or revoked or on whom an order has been issued. The director shall adopt guidelines on what constitutes an emergency.
