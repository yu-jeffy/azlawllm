Applications shall be accompanied by a license fee of one hundred twenty-five dollars per year for each separate place of business used in the manufacture of commercial fertilizers in this state. Applications of manufacturers or distributors having no established place of business in this state, but otherwise subject to a license under this section, shall be accompanied by a license fee of one hundred twenty-five dollars per year. All licenses issued through 1998 shall expire on the last day of February of the following year. Beginning in 1999, the director may provide by rule for licenses having a term of one or more years and may prescribe the date on which licenses expire. Licenses are not transferable and no credit or refund may be granted for licenses held for less than a full license year. Monies collected from license fees shall be allocated as follows:

The director may provide by rule for multiyear licenses. Applications for registration shall be accompanied by a registration fee of fifty dollars per year per brand and grade of specialty fertilizer. The director may, after opportunity for hearing, decrease or increase the registration fee prescribed by this subsection but at no time shall the rate exceed one hundred dollars per year.
