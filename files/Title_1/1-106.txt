1-106.Supplements as part of Revised Statutes
A. The laws contained in current pocket parts or supplements to these Revised Statutes, printed and published hereafter as may be authorized by law, shall constitute, prima facie, a part of these Revised Statutes, if such laws, as so contained, purport to represent reproductions of laws enacted by the legislature subsequent to the date these Revised Statutes become effective.
B. If such pocket parts or supplements are printed and published on a cumulative basis, then only such laws as are contained in the latest publication thereof shall constitute, prima facie, a part of these Revised Statutes.
C. The authentication of such pocket parts under the facsimile signature of the secretary of state, and a printed reproduction of the great seal of the state of Arizona, shall be sufficient to satisfy the purposes and conditions of this section.
